Repository to keep my studies of JavaScript.

🌟

# Hello 🌐

Welcome to my JavaScript bookmark. 📚

💻 Here you will find a summary of the JavaScript language I have studied and am studying.
⌨ Through it you can access my syntax notes.

💾 My intention with this project is to organize my notes, facilitate my access to them, and of course, be able to share some of my summaries with anyone who is interested.🔍

This is all, and hands-on. 🏁




note: this repository will be frequently updated !
